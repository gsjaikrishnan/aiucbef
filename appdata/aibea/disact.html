<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px"><span style="color: #fffffe;"><strong>The procedure for taking any disciplinary action against employees is well-defined and codified under the Bipartite Settlement dated 10th April, 2002 between the Union and the management (IBA).The nature of charges that can be leveled against the employees is categorized and grouped as Major Misconduct and Minor Misconduct.Types of punishments that management can impose on the employees for any proven misconduct are also defined in the Settlement.Management has to follow the set procedure and prove the charges before imposing punishment.</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px"><span style="color: #fffffe;"><strong>Employee has the right to be defended by the Union.</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:18px"><span style="color: #fffffe;"><strong>Hence whenever any memo, charge-sheet, show-cause letter is given to any employee, the union should be contacted.  No reply or any statement or apology letter should be given without consulting the Union.  Union will guide the employees to submit suitable reply.Employees should learn and be thorough with their work, rules and procedures, be courteous to customers and superiors, follow the laid down instructions, etc. so that no room is given for any disciplinary action.Special caution is necessary while working in the computers like non-handing over the password, etc., to avoid misuse by others.</strong></span></span></p>
