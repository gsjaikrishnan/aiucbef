								<p>We trust that the under mentioned letters sent by us to you have been placed before you.
HO/ HRM/GM/36/2017-20 DT 28/11/2018. REGARDING ISSUES DEALT IN THE GR
MEETING AND POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING
HO/HRM/GM/37/2017-20 DT 19/12/2018 REGARDING BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE AND
CONSEQUENTIAL PROBLEMS.
HO/ HRM/ GM/ 38/2017-20. DT 02/01/2109. REGARDING IR SITUATION IN JAIPUR
We hope that the above letters have received your needed attention.
We are however disappointed to observe that neither there is acknowledgement of
having received our communications nor visible and needed steps appear to have been
taken on the issues raised through the letters.
We will not be misunderstood for our understanding of the attitude, approach and
functioning of the department. We are reminded that way back in 2006/07 when there
was a move on restructuring the departments, we were impressed upon about the need
for redefining the role of the then Personnel Department by bifurcating it into Personnel
Services Department and Human Resources Management Department. We were told by
those who scripted the paradigm shift that Human Capital is to be considered more
important than Financial Capital and hence there is greater need to focus on molding
Human Resources to take on the future of the Institution. Willingly or otherwise the
Management kept engaging the unions / associations, duly recognizing them as
representatives of various segments of the Human Resources - Workforce, on all
matters including the health of the Institution.
HRM is responsible for framing policies that would provide right environment for the
Work force to play their role and contribute their best in achieving the Goal set by
corporate. HRM is responsible for maintaining harmony in the Industrial Relations Front.
Sound HR Policies can alone serve as motivation and morale booster to the workforce.
Similarly harmonious climate in the bank can only contribute to the Positive mindset to
the workforce. In both the fronts the role of Management and the representative unions
must be on the same page.
But what we are witnessing in the recent past is that Administration in our Bank has
chosen to adopt indifferent approach towards unions and as a result the entire
atmosphere is vitiated. When the representative unions are aggrieved or treated with
attitude of neglect what kind of message goes down to the work force? Even if the
Unions are looked at with discomfort and unwanted, at-least the Management should
remain responsive to the grievances of the employees and address them in time. HRM is
not comfortable if employees or their state units conveying their grievances directly.
HRM is equally not responsive when the issues are taken up by the Apex body. What
else is the mechanism available for the employees to get their grievances redressed?
How aggrieved employees can be expected to get motivated to give their best for the
growth of the Institution?
It is also worth to quote the under mentioned clauses from the IR policy - approved by
the Board on 26/2/2013 and circulated vide communication CHO/PAS/01/2013-14 DT.
22/04/2013.
PARA 1.2 : Only a responsive human resource management is the key to a healthy and
robust organisation, the Management has to have in place a mechanism for taking timely
decisions representative of the expectations of the majority of its workman employees.
This is all the more necessary in the present competitive environment when the Bank is
required to continuously upgrade and fine tune it's working to maintain edge over others.
Para 2.1: in the dynamic Miley in which the Bank operates, managing harmonious human
relations is imperative for ensuring steady business growth in order that the
Management is able to continuously keep itself abreast of the expectations and
aspirations of the human resource, it is necessary that a structure of Industrial Relation
is put in place to streamline various aspects of human relations. As it makes eminent
sense to heed the majority sentiment of the workforce of workman employees, the Bank
is putting in place mechanism as a tool to promote self-reliance, mutual goodwill, trust,
confidence and cooperation for achieving Bank's mission.
Para 5.5: The Management will not enter into correspondence with the union at the
branch level. The correspondence emanating from President/ General Secretaries at the
state Units will be given cognizance by Zonal Heads and communications emanating
from Central units will only be responded by Head office.
Thus we find that HRM is found wanting in fulfillment of the objectives of the above
policy.
As a responsible trade union, we have resisted our temptation of placing any demand
that would financially burden the Bank at this hour of crises. All the issues that have
been starving for solution are well within the ambit of the existing policies like
promotions, transfer, corrections of wrongs, mitigation of hardship faced by the
employees, attitude related, payments due as per law etc. All that we insist is that timely
action on the issues dealt in the forums like GR Committee. We are unable to understand
and appreciate what is holding the Department in taking timely actions?
We shall be thankful if the under mentioned questions agitating our mind are answered.
Why Substaff promotions are held up even after a lapse of one year since release of
Scale -1 promotions?
Why graduate Substaff promotions are withheld much against the provisions - 4.6 of
PPA 2012, as per which promotions should have to be twice in a year without having to
wait for declaration of vacancies?
Why the Management is reluctant to advise the Zones for filling the vacancies of
Daftaries by making eligible the House Keeper cum Peons as per agreement dt 6
th
July
2015?
Why the management is reluctant to advise some zones to notify the existing vacancies
of Special Assistants and Head Cashiers?
Why the Management is unable to honor its commitment to amend the PPA for
according recognition to the Army Graduate Certificate?
What reservation the Management has, in revising the cost of uniform which was last
revised in 2012, knowing well the cost of material and labour had gone up in the last 6/7
years?
What are the factors contributing to the inability of Management to consider the
employees recruited after 1/11/1993 as Pension Optees when the settlement is clear
that those joined the Bank on or after 1/11/1993 are deemed Optees?
What are the compulsions in not taking steps to advise the Zones indulging in violations
of clause 9.6 of PPA (SHIMLA), Request Transfer Policy (Bhopal) Ho's instructions with
regard to postings of new recruits - request transfers to get precedence (Jaipur)?
What are the problems coming in the way to clarify to zones reiterating clause 5.6.8 of
PPA, 2012 with regard to uniform effective date for those selected for functional
allowance posts?
What are the reasons to deny bonus to Daily Wagers when Bonus Act provides for it and
all other Banks having complied with it?
What are the hurdles in granting fair wages to Daily wagers & Canteen Boys under
minimum wages act?
How the Management proposes to address the concerns of the branches which are
reeling under severe shortage of clerical and substaff as a result complaints of
excessive work including supervisory in nature are forced upon the clerical staff, non
sanction of leave, harassment of staff, intimidatory attitude of branch heads etc are
pouring in besides hampering customer service and growth?
How compassion can be shown if the employment is denied to sons or daughters of the
deceased by insisting only spouse should apply?
Why the human element is absent in the matter of considering request transfers,
particularly those involving Interstate and are undergoing trauma due to health issues,
spouse joining, health issues of near and dear etc?
Why the HO should remain muted on the complaint of women employees being posted
in remote branches which are not even provided with basic amenities like wash rooms
etc?
Why HRM is reluctant to take on the Erring Zonal Heads whose attitude and approach
trigger unrest in the IR front?
Why the Staff welfare Committee is not called as per it's own decision for convening
meetings well before the end of FY for reviewing the implementation of various schemes
and expenditure incurred?
Why there is sudden halt to Apex Level Performance Review Committee meetings when
there is a call for ONE TEAM, ONE DREAM?
What are the views of HRM with regard to our Observations on introduction of Biometric
Attendance?
What has come in the way in taking follow up measures to the discussions held in the
Policy Committee meeting held in October, 2018?
Why many Zonal Heads are refusing to hold periodical IR meetings?
Above all what are the compelling reasons for widening gap between the Administration
and the Representatives / Representative unions and how the Bank views the
deteriorating situation in the IR front?
We hope and trust that this communication will be taken in the right spirit and our
anxiety and concerns are well understood besides treating this as the one reflecting the
ground level situation. We are equally hopeful that HRM will do well by finding ways and
means to correct the situation and prove worthy of its existence.</p>

							  <div class="panel-body">
								<p>We are constrained to write to you to inform that several matters relating to workman staff are remaining unresolved or unimplemented and all our efforts to take to resolve or get implemented through persuasive means have failed to bring in any result. We are sorry to say that even the routine meetings at the Apex Level either to resolve the individual grievances or relating to policy matters are not being held in the last six months. What to say even matters which were discussed and agreed to be resolved in earlier meetings - the last such meeting was held on 23/11/2015 - are yet to be translated into action. Even our repeated communications requesting for a meeting of the Policy committee to discuss several policy related matters is yet to be responded despite passage of nearly a year. Thus there are large numbers issues both individual and Policy related, remain unaddressed for quite a long time. Whatever was envisaged through the IR policy, the management has not lived up to its purpose, which we feel is neither healthy nor fair. An impression is gaining ground that the Management is neither willing to adhere to the healthy industrial relation not keen to respect the Majority union that it deserves. It is also our strong view that the PSD and HRM have failed to rise to the fair expectations of the work force. Many issues are lingering either for want of decision or for even want of attention of the concerned or competent authorities. You will agree that PSD and HRM departments have their role to play, if not more at least not less important than other departments in the Bank. But it is unfortunate that the Management at the top does not feel 0 appropriate to ensure functioning and performance of these departments so as to live up to the purpose for which these departments are created. We are giving under, some important among those long pending issues for your immediate understanding of our agitated feelings.</p>

<p>The above are some, just to indicate to you how we have been exercising patience for unduly long time and are now compelled to consider different options to secure justice to the workforce. We should not be mis-understood if we say that if the collective organisational steps or action is the only way to secure results to our fair demands, our Federation shall not hesitate to employ such actions. However as a responsible trade union and as a last resort, are approaching the Head of the Bank with a hope that your intervention would avoid any undesirable situation in the Bank.As we are keen to avoid such a situation, we feel that we should meet you in person at the early date convenient to you and place before you in detail about our views on the Industrial Relationship in the Bank and find amicable ways and means to address the increasing concerns of our members. We hope you will understand and appreciate our responsible approach and advise us your response at the earliest.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
							  <div class="panel-body">
								<p>Reference to discussions we had in the last Apex Level performance Review Committee and subsequent communications addressed to you by our Federations. Deeply concerned by the prevailing situation in the Bank and also by certain unilateral decisions of the top management, we are submitting this memorandum to your good selves with a hope of securing positive response from you.BANK'S HEALTH : We are very much disturbed and concerned over the problems and ills that are confronting our beloved Institution. We are aware that our Bank is not an exception and many other Banks are subjected to similar pressure due to rising level of Non performing and stressed assets. A careful Scrutiny of the Balance sheet reveals that unlike many other banks, our Bank's earnings and operational profit have been grievously hit, besides placing our Bank in the top as far as the level of NPA is concerned. It is a matter for concern that operation profit which was hovering close to 5000 crore in the previous two financial years, has come down to 3600 crore. It is equally disturbing that Bank's total business has come down by more than 20000 cr. While we are conscious that it is not the time for pointing fingers against any section or indulge in blame game, certain factors should not escape the attention of all of us. In other words there is need to analyse, if not introspect, those factors which have contributed to the present crisis. All of us - the Administration, work force and unions / associations - need to look back and identify those factors responsible for the present ills and apply our collective wisdom to re-work strategies necessary to put the Bank in its proper track. More than 50% of the work force have come into the Bank just a few years back and have longer innings to play. They have come into the Bank with lot of expectations and dreams about their future. Their hopes should not be shattered. We have to guarantee their future. It is therefore imperative upon all of us at the Apex Level to stay close, move with sense of oneness, plan prudently and ensure its execution perfectly. In our assessment of the situation we observe that.Urgent and appropriate steps are needed to remove the feeling of total disconnect between people who matter and people who look to them.Extra-ordinary steps to keep high the morale of the work force is the need of the hour. Consistent and constant efforts are necessary to instill confidence in the minds of decision makers at different level, as, fear of being made accountable even for bonafide business decisions or inadvertent/ unintended human error, has engulfed the whole atmosphere in the Bank, serving as a demotivating/discouraging factor at all levels of management. Understanding of issues that are confronting the branches and extending deserving and timely support to enable them to function with comfort and confidence, to be able to remain focused on the development, & develop appetite to achieve the target, is another important aspect that no one should ignore.in sum and substance it is our submission that Administration should be seen by the work force as an inspiring one, as a supporter and as a guiding force. It is needless to say that employees and officers don't lack in their commitment to the institution. But their morale and confidence level are at a new low. This is one area which need to be addressed on priority.We being the representatives of the work force have always endeavoured ourselves towards well being of our beloved bank. But we also feel that our genuine concern is not being trusted by the top management as a result gap between the unions/associations and the top management has widened. You will agree and appreciate that in a situation where the Bank's identity is under threat and media is speculating about merger of Banks, all of us need to stand up with a sense of oneness and commitment, not only to defend our identity but more so to rejuvenate the Bank and place it in the path of progress. From the unions we are of the strong view that the work force should not be allowed to be further demoralised or demotivated by such speculations. No one should be allowed to feel as if all is over. If appropriate steps are not taken to counter the situation polluted with the speculations about merger, Bank will be further hurt and face irreparable damage. We also equally feel that extra ordinary efforts need to be employed to retrieve the Bank from the present impasse and re-energize it with capability to stand to the onslaught of merger attempts. This calls for greater sense of unity and understanding between all section- Top management, Administration at all levels and field level work force. While we as responsible unions and associations, having grown with the Bank, having seen the bad and good days of the Bank, having countered the similar threat of closure and merger in 1990s successfully, reassure our endeavour to be part of all the efforts to steer the Bank in the desired direction, we are eager to hear from the head of the Bank as to the steps that are being taken and that are proposed to be taken to revitalize the Bank and regain it's status. It is to be taken as our strong view that under any circumstances Bank s identity is not allowed to be the subject matter of debate and no sacrifice will be big enough to keep its flag flying high. It will not be construed as a misplaced one if we demand a well structured discussions with our unions/associations, which we hope would go a long way in changing the winds in favour of the Bank.Man-power Position in branches : We are disturbed to be informed that at your directions, earlier decision of Recruiting 1300 officers and 2500 clerks had been revisited and number has been substantially reduced. As against the indent placed to IBPS for recruitment of 1300 officers number has been slashed down to 700 and Clerical to 1410 against 2500. You may be aware that even the number originally arrived at for requirement was far less compared to the actual need of the branches. In the last five years, our Bank has deliberately been conservative in supplying needed man power to the branches as a result already 10% of the branches are operating with single officer, nearly 25% of the branches are functioning with out head Cashier or Cash officer while equal number of branches are to pull on with out even a single Clerical staff, around 500 big branches are under-staffed, and more than 1/3rd branches are depending on casual workers or outsourced arrangements in the absence of permanent peons. Our repeated plea for providing minimum man power support to the branches has been ignored as a result.Branches are unable to get focused on development, People are dis- enthused to scout for new accounts, Credibility before the customers too takes a beating, & Quality of business and service too becomes a casualty. There has been a genuine fear that accounts cannot be serviced and maintained in the absence of adequate man power. Needless to draw your attention the plight of branches which are also to cater to the need of less fortunate people covered by various social welfare schemes of the Central and state governments. You may be aware that there are understandings - written and un-written - codifying minimum man power in all categories linking to productivity and business. But the management has been least concerned to take a call either on the basis of these understandings or on the basis of the demands from the field. Thus decisions were being taken for recruitment of clerks and officers with out any method of madness, mindless of the consequential adverse effects on the Bank s progress. Now your decision to down size the number will add to the woes of the branches. It is therefore our demand that immediate steps are to be initiated to arrive at the proper requirement and needful done so that development - much needed retail business - and customer service besides the well being of the work force are taken care.RESTRUCTURING OF ADMINISTRATIVE SET UP : We are to recall the extensive discussions the then top management under the leadership of Sri.Sridhar had with our unions when Boston company was engaged for restructuring both business and administrative set up. Then the entire administrative set up and business structure were changed with huge cost. Again in 2007/08, the top management under the leadership of Sri.Goel held discussions with us for commissioning Field Level General Managers offices in different locations. Even though we had some reservations on the desirability of having one more tier and on the additional expenditure, yet we did not stand in the way looking to the much patted set up. Of course subsequently Sri.Arun Kaul the previous chairman desired to re-christen the name of FGM office as Circle offices. In our experience the circle offices failed to live up to the purpose even as many of the Zonal offices, located by the side of Circle offices became defunct. It is also to be placed on record that on many occasions the board deliberated on the subject of capability of Zonal offices to control the number of branches. In all the occasions it was a consensus view that the number of branches should not exceed 40/50 under each Zonal Office to have effective control and monitoring. Keeping this in view from time to time, new Zonal Offices were commissioned commensurate with branch expansion. Now a recent decision of the Bank to rationalize the circle offices and Zonal offices is not consistent with the principle and norms practiced for long and we are of the view it is not pragmatic too. This is the reason we felt that, had we been taken into confidence and had there been thorough debate on this between the unions and the management, we could have contributed to the views, sharing our experience. Unfortunately the management has thought it fit to ignore the unions and took some decision which according to us is not beneficial to the Bank and on the contrary may make things difficult both for some circle and Zonal heads to achieve the desired result. Here again we lay emphasis for adopting consistent approach both in making the changes to work and in saving cost / reducing expenditure. We look forward to have our views considered by your good selves through discussions.While we once again reiterate our commitment to play our role,even beyond the call of duty in the progress and prosperity of our beloved Institution we look forward to your approach of collaboration if you feel that such collective effort would produce desired results.</p><a href="http://aiucbef.com/circulars/union/jm1jun16.pdf" class="button button-reveal button-small button-rounded tright"><i class="icon-angle-right"></i><span>Circular</span></a>
